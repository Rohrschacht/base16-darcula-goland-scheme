# base16-darcula-goland-scheme

This theme is a modified version of [base16-darcula-scheme](https://github.com/casonadams/base16-darcula-scheme),
which itself is inspired by the Darcula theme of the Jetbrains IDEs.

I really like the Darcula theme in my Jetbrains IDEs, which is why I want to use
it in other software as well. The base16-darcula-scheme is however not close
enough to Jetbrain's Darcula theme for my liking. I therefore took it as a base,
set it as my emacs theme and compared the colors with the ones of the GoLand IDE
on the same Go source file. I then changed the colors which didn't match between
base16-darcula-theme and what was displayed in GoLand.
